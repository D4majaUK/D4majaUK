# Welcome

**Jack of all trades, master of none...**
While some may look at this and think, *amateur*, this is not a website to impress, this is a site to store some thoughts/ideas/solutions. 
Technically a knowledge-dump as and when the mood takes. *I'm not technical, but......* - watch out for this series, coming soon.

## Documentation

Ha ha ha ha ha! Documentation has always been so far at the back of my mind, I don't even think it will ever push forwad to reach the front. 
In the earlier days that was called lazy. Today, we call it Agile ;)

## Thanks

I would like to give thanks to those, who without believing they have done anything, have been the inspiration that has got me to where I am today.
Outside of family, the first gratitude goes to Mr Draycott from my secondary school. A Computer Studies teacher who told me I would never get a job in Computing.
Admittedly, I never seemd to care about any subjects back then. But that stubborness inside burned strong, long and hard, and I had to prove him wrong. 
Here's to you Mr Draycott.....from the the cheeky IT (Computer) Consultant that never was to be :)

Importantly to my family and close friends, who always stood by me, always believed in their *Computer Genius* - Love and Respect!

Thank you to all the employers/hiring managers who gave me a chance to shine. Even though I don't oversell my skill set, you took the risk to allow me to progress.
