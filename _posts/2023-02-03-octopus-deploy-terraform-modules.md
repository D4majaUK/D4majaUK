# Problem

While Octopus Deploy (OD) handles a flat inline source Terraform template without issue (unless you make mistakes),
there comes the problem when you want to implement more complex solutions. In particular modules.
In the usual Terraform scenario, you'd develop a folder structure that allows you to separate out the templates.
However, OD doesn't make this easy within the inline edit box. But all is not lost...
As you can see below, OD allows you to use packages.

When I first saw this, I thought, Oh Great! Now I have to link it to a source code repository (which along the lines of IaC, 
that would kind of make sense and will be the goal later). As this was just getting to grips with using OD with Terraform,
it is not something I also want to have to manage, until at least I get it working as expected. Anyway, let's get onto the solution.
It is actually a straight forward process, we just need to upload a package and then it can be referenced within the process.


# Solution

1. Create the folder structure for Terraform.
2. Build out the Terraform implementation within that structure.
3. Zip it up.
4. Upload to the in-built package store.
5. Reference within the template.
6. Deploy the solution.
