>I’m not technical, but....I completed a project that demonstrated my programming capabilities on the Amiga 500.
>Manipulating the music track timeline, I was able to trigger graphical changes at points along the way.
>
>The video footage was sampled in from a video digitiser as frames that I programmed to display one after another.
>The audio equipment was a replication of real products that I actually owned.
>
>The experience in graphics gained from the game software company was put into use and paved the way to other projects.

>I’m not technical, but....I got my first Personal Computer which cost £1,000. 
>From that point, I thought I would be able to do so much more that I was able to do on my Amiga computer.
>
>I upgraded the motherboard, memory and added a Plextor CD Burner - back then it was 2x (that’s right, 2 speed).
>
>I created my first Damaja CD (entitled CD Stylee) - This was a compilation of the Amiga Soundtracker created tracks, 
>blended with sections of cartoons and entertainment programmes to split it up.

>I’m not technical, but....I was asked to make some changes to a project written in a development environment called FoxPro. 
>This was something I hadn't had experience in, but there was a manual and faith that I could work it out.
>
>I made a couple of changes and hated every minute of looking at code that had not been structured, 
>which meant very difficult to make changes without causing problems elsewhere. 
>And the fact that it was FoxPro for Windows and there was a better version for the Windows platform in the form of Visual FoxPro.
>
>After 3 requests for changes/bug-fixes, I decided to speak with the customer to see if he was prepared to put the current version to bed.
>If so, I would be able to develop a totally new version from scratch. It was a definite, YES!!
>
>I even created a technical document, split into sections of current...proposed and mock-ups (shown above).
>
>I completed the project some weeks later, to the irritation of my then manager who reminded me that there is a cost to every piece of work we do.
>For what I had already done, was not authorised. Oh well, but the customer is always right, surely :)

# Local Authority

>I’m not technical, but....This place sort of proved this to be true, temporarily. 
>Picture an interview scenario for a permanent role, where i’m asked a simple question: Do you have experience in MS-DOS?
>I remember it so well. My response was.....No! I don’t know what that is.
>
>Skip back a couple of years, and I'm using the command line daily at college. MS-DOS and command line are the same. 
>This I didn’t realise.
>
>Fortunate for me, I ended up working in the same office as the person who actually got the job I applied for and failed. 
>This was maternity cover, so I had maybe a year to get some skills.
>
>The job entailed printouts of all outstanding jobs. This was delivered at the beginning of the week.
>I had to go through them and find the ones that had breached the expected timeframe. An exciting job using a highlighter. 
>This is what a non-technical person does for a living.
>
>In order to save money, the idea was to download the list and manipulate it locally. 
>They had a Relational Database Management System by IBM Informix called Smart 3.1.
>Imagine a very early version of Microsoft Office before Windows arrived.
>
>Simple process to defined was as follows:
>
>Download the records, Import them into the database, Select the breached records, Jump to the Spreadsheet application, Split by depot and print out.
>
>The amount of money and time this saved was good enough to keep me on at the company beyond the return of the maternity cover. 
>I would then see quite a lot of requests for more reports.
>
>Smart 3.1 was then updated to Smartware II - a better suite of applications, allowing more complexity of what could be done.
