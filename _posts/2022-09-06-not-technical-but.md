# C64 Emulator - Open Border Demo

<video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19514070/200871606-e5757375-2a18-40cd-a38a-d95ec9d9500b.mp4" data-canonical-src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19514070/200871606-e5757375-2a18-40cd-a38a-d95ec9d9500b.mp4" controls="controls" muted="muted" class="d-block rounded-bottom-2 width-fit" style="max-height:640px;"></video>

>I’m not technical, but…..If I skip forward to 2015 and find a Commodore 64 emulator and an Assembler, I should be able to make a simple demo. This would incorporate some of the things I used to do back in the day.
>
>Add a some self-created music on top and a little video composition and voila! we have a demo that takes us back, way back, back in time.

# Frequency Demo - Amiga A500

<video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19514070/188760394-ad70f3f3-d755-4afa-904d-82912d1a855d.mp4" data-canonical-src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19514070/188760394-ad70f3f3-d755-4afa-904d-82912d1a855d.mp4" controls="controls" muted="muted" class="d-block rounded-bottom-2 width-fit" style="max-height:640px;"></video>

>I’m not technical, but....I completed a project that demonstrated my programming capabilities on the Amiga 500.
>Manipulating the music track timeline, I was able to trigger graphical changes at points along the way.
>
>The video footage was sampled in from a video digitiser as frames that I programmed to display one after another.
>The audio equipment was a replication of real products that I actually owned.
>
>The experience in graphics gained from the game software company was put into use and paved the way to other projects.

# First Personal Computer (PC)

![First Computer](/Portfolio/images/not-technical-but/FirstComputer.jpg)

>I’m not technical, but....I got my first Personal Computer which cost £1,000. 
>From that point, I thought I would be able to do so much more that I was able to do on my Amiga computer.
>
>I upgraded the motherboard, memory and added a Plextor CD Burner - back then it was 2x (that’s right, 2 speed).
>
>I created my first Damaja CD (entitled CD Stylee) - This was a compilation of the Amiga Soundtracker created tracks, 
>blended with sections of cartoons and entertainment programmes to split it up.

>I’m not technical, but....I was asked to make some changes to a project written in a development environment called FoxPro. 
>This was something I hadn't had experience in, but there was a manual and faith that I could work it out.
>
>I made a couple of changes and hated every minute of looking at code that had not been structured, 
>which meant very difficult to make changes without causing problems elsewhere. 
>And the fact that it was FoxPro for Windows and there was a better version for the Windows platform in the form of Visual FoxPro.
>
>After 3 requests for changes/bug-fixes, I decided to speak with the customer to see if he was prepared to put the current version to bed.
>If so, I would be able to develop a totally new version from scratch. It was a definite, YES!!
>
>I even created a technical document, split into sections of current...proposed and mock-ups (shown above).
>
>I completed the project some weeks later, to the irritation of my then manager who reminded me that there is a cost to every piece of work we do.
>For what I had already done, was not authorised. Oh well, but the customer is always right, surely :)

# Local Authority

![Local Authority](/Portfolio/images/not-technical-but/LocalAuthority.jpg)

>I’m not technical, but....This place sort of proved this to be true, temporarily. 
>Picture an interview scenario for a permanent role, where i’m asked a simple question: Do you have experience in MS-DOS?
>I remember it so well. My response was.....No! I don’t know what that is.
>
>Skip back a couple of years, and I'm using the command line daily at college. MS-DOS and command line are the same. 
>This I didn’t realise.
>
>Fortunate for me, I ended up working in the same office as the person who actually got the job I applied for and failed. 
>This was maternity cover, so I had maybe a year to get some skills.
>
>The job entailed printouts of all outstanding jobs. This was delivered at the beginning of the week.
>I had to go through them and find the ones that had breached the expected timeframe. An exciting job using a highlighter. 
>This is what a non-technical person does for a living.
>
>In order to save money, the idea was to download the list and manipulate it locally. 
>They had a Relational Database Management System by IBM Informix called Smart 3.1.
>Imagine a very early version of Microsoft Office before Windows arrived.
>
>Simple process to defined was as follows:
>
>Download the records, Import them into the database, Select the breached records, Jump to the Spreadsheet application, Split by depot and print out.
>
>The amount of money and time this saved was good enough to keep me on at the company beyond the return of the maternity cover. 
>I would then see quite a lot of requests for more reports.
>
>Smart 3.1 was then updated to Smartware II - a better suite of applications, allowing more complexity of what could be done.

# Next Big Upgrade

![C64](/Portfolio/images/not-technical-but/C64.jpg)

![C64-Manuals](/Portfolio/images/not-technical-but/C64-Manuals.jpg)

>I’m not technical, but.....I upgraded from the Commodore VIC-20 to the Commodore 64. This had a whopping 64K RAM (Random Access Memory - of which, only 38K RAM was useable). Now this was the mac-daddy in my mind at the time. Before I got this, I used to go to Dixons (popular store for tech) and trial out the Commodore 64. I had moved on a little from BASIC to the much faster MACHINE CODE. A series of POKE commands would changed the border colour at such a fast rate in a loop that gave the impression that every 5 or so lines was a different colour. This was also called turbo lines. And with a few more POKE commands would also change the screen colour, so the whole screen was changing colour in lines.
>
>But I didn’t just stop there, I wanted to do some serious stuff on my Commodore 64. I bought the Commodore 64 Programmers Reference Guide - for anyone serious about programming, this was like the bible. It gave all the POKEable locations in ROM (Read Only Memory).

# First Upgrade

![Vic20-Screen](/Portfolio/images/not-technical-but/Vic20-Screen.jpg)

>I’m not technical, but.....there was also this device that accompanied the Commodore VIC-20. This would make all the hard earned effort recoverable. It gave the ability to load/save the things that I had typed into my Commodore VIC-20. 
>
>The first game I created from nothing was called SKI RUN. A very simple game to today’s standards, but back then it was great. The screen scrolled up and obstacles appeared in your path - so you had to move your character left and right to avoid them. 
>
>I was added a score counter and a concept of lives. Once your lives ran out it would just print “GAME OVER” on the screen and then the “READY” prompt appeared.

# First Home Computer

![First Home Computer](/Portfolio/images/not-technical-but/Vic20.jpg)

>I’m not technical, but…..In 1982, I was gifted with my first home computer. The Commodore VIC-20 with 5K of RAM (which back then seemed like such a lot of memory to play around with). This computer started me off in the world of BASIC - Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (I think that’s what it was). My first computer program was as follows:
>
>**10 PRINT “COMMODORE VIC-20″**
>
>**20 GOTO 10**
>
>Moving on from the simple stuff, I used to buy computer magazines that had free games included.  But not as we know it today, these had to be typed in. And you could almost bet your life on it that it would never work first time. You had to search through hundreds of lines of code to find the typing error or even worse, you had to fix a bug.
>
>This was legendary back in the day, and I felt like I had entered a secret world of the what I now know to be Geekdom.

# Introduction

>Here we are with my blog all about not being technical. As you look through this blog you may notice something, something that may contradict the perceived focus of this blog. But I won’t give the whole game away. I’m not a technical guy (and many have told me this along my life journey), and here’s the evidence so you can see for yourself.

>I hope you find this an interesting insight
