>I’m not technical, but....In 1991 I completed a project that demonstrated my programming capabilities on the Amiga 500.
>Manipulating the music track timeline, I was able to trigger graphical changes at points along the way.
>
>The video footage was sampled in from a video digitiser as frames that I programmed to display one after another.
>The audio equipment was a replication of real products that I actually owned.
>
>The experience in graphics gained from the game software company was put into use and paved the way to other projects.

>I’m not technical, but....I got my first Personal Computer which cost £1,000. 
>From that point, I thought I would be able to do so much more that I was able to do on my Amiga computer.
>
>In 1995, I upgraded the motherboard, memory and added a Plextor CD Burner - back then it was 2x (that’s right, 2 speed).
>
>In 1996, I created my first Damaja CD (entitled CD Stylee) - This was a compilation of the Amiga Soundtracker created tracks, 
>blended with sections of cartoons and entertainment programmes to split it up.

>I’m not technical, but....In 1992 I was asked to make some changes to a project written in a development environment called FoxPro. 
>This was something I hadn't had experience in, but there was a manual and faith that I could work it out.
>
>I made a couple of changes and hated every minute of looking at code that had not been structured, 
>which meant very difficult to make changes without causing problems elsewhere. 
>And the fact that it was FoxPro for Windows and there was a better version for the Windows platform in the form of Visual FoxPro.
>
>After 3 requests for changes/bug-fixes, I decided to speak with the customer to see if he was prepared to put the current version to bed.
>If so, I would be able to develop a totally new version from scratch. It was a definite, YES!!
>
>I even created a technical document, split into sections of current...proposed and mock-ups (shown above).
>
>I completed the project some weeks later, to the irritation of my then manager who reminded me that there is a cost to every piece of work we do.
>For what I had already done, was not authorised. Oh well, but the customer is always right, surely :)
