I’m not technical, but....I got my first Personal Computer which cost £1,000. 
From that point, I thought I would be able to do so much more that I was able to do on my Amiga computer.

In 1995, I upgraded the motherboard, memory and added a Plextor CD Burner - back then it was 2x (that’s right, 2 speed).

In 1996, I created my first Damaja CD (entitled CD Stylee) - This was a compilation of the Amiga Soundtracker created tracks, 
blended with sections of cartoons and entertainment programmes to split it up.
