I’m not technical, but....In 1992 I was asked to make some changes to a project written in a development environment called FoxPro. This was something I hadn't had experience in, but there was a manual and faith that I could work it out.

I made a couple of changes and hated every minute of looking at code that had not been structured, which meant very difficult to make changes without causing problems elsewhere. And the fact that it was FoxPro for Windows and there was a better version for the Windows platform in the form of Visual FoxPro.

After 3 requests for changes/bug-fixes, I decided to speak with the customer to see if he was prepared to put the current version to bed and develop a totally new version from scratch. It was a definite, YES!!

I even created a technical document, split into sections of current...proposed and mock-ups (shown above).

I completed the project some weeks later, to the irritation of my then manager who reminded me that there is a cost to every piece of work we do and that was not authorised. Oh well, but the customer is always right, surely :)

# First Computer

I’m not technical, but....I got my first Personal Computer which cost £1,000. 
From that point, I thought I would be able to do so much more that I was able to do on my Amiga computer.

In 1995, I upgraded the motherboard, memory and added a Plextor CD Burner - back then it was 2x (that’s right, 2 speed).

In 1996, I created my first Damaja CD (entitled CD Stylee) - This was a compilation of the Amiga Soundtracker created tracks, 
blended with sections of cartoons and entertainment programmes to split it up.
