My name is ***Anthony Barrett MBCS*** and this is my mini-blog site. I decided to create this in order to start documenting some of the ideas I have implemented. I am heavily focused around automation, removing the manually repeatable steps where possible. Giving people back more time to do new/interesting things.

This site will always be a work-in-progress/on-going, as you never seem to stop learning in the IT industry with it evolving continuously.
